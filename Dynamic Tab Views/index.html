                    <p>SDP stands for Software Development Project. It is a core
                        subject in the curriculum of computer science and engineering at VIT. The
                        purpose of this subject is to help students develop practical skills in
                        software development, project management, and team collaboration. Students
                        work in teams to design, develop, and test a software system that meets the
                        requirements of a real-world client. The project is typically completed over
                        two semesters and culminates in a final presentation to the client and a panel
                        of faculty members.</p>

                    <p>Course Projects are a crucial part of the curriculum of
                        computer science and engineering at VIT. They give students an opportunity to
